# Drinks Project by C# Academy

Project Link: <https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/15/drinks>

## Project Requirements

- A restaurant hired you to create a solution for their drinks menu.
- Drink data comes from an external company’s database via an API.
- Your system must allow employees to retrieve drink details easily.
- No SQL is needed—just a simple and user-friendly interface.
- When opening the app, users should see a drinks category menu.
- After selecting a category, they choose a drink to view details.
- Drink details should never include empty properties.

## Additional Challenges

- No extra challenges were specified for this project.

## Lessons Learned

- First, I learned how to send HTTP requests in a C# application.
- Discovered a useful library for API calls but did manual deserialization.
- To practice, I used the JSONPlaceholder API before starting the project.
- This helped me understand how to retrieve and parse API responses.
- I explored reflection to filter drink details into a cleaner object.
- While reflection didn’t add much functionality, it helped with organization.

## Areas for Improvement

- The free API only provides a maximum of 100 results.
- I couldn’t find any documentation confirming if pagination is supported.
- This limits the number of drinks the system can access.
